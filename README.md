# wsclean-pydec
A Python deconvolution support has been added, but not yet released, by Andr√© Offrina to __[WSClean](https://gitlab.com/aroffringa/wsclean)__, which can now execute a python script during each major deconvolution iteration.

## Usage
The Python support in WSClean is called by the parameter `-python-deconvolution <filename>`, 
which runs a custom deconvolution algorithm written in Python.
For example, a full Python deconvolution WSClean run looks like this:
```
wsclean -size 1024 1024 -scale 1amin -niter 1000000 -mgain 0.8 -auto-threshold 5 \
  -python-deconvolution deconvolution-example.py 1052736496-averaged.ms
```

## Python scripts
In the `python_script` directory there are useful scripts (and codes), e.g., to handle fits files.

-  `fix_source_list.py`: it adds a progressive number after the source name if there are more than one source with the same name.

-  `genBlank.py`: it takes in input a template fits file to generate a blank fits (i.e. setting all pixels to zero) with the same template features.

- `gen_simMS.py`: it generates an MS file with visibilities simulated from a sky model, using the `predict` step of the __[DPPP](https://www.astron.nl/citt/DP3/#)__ pipeline. A (white) noise, drawn by a complex Gaussian distribution CN(0,&sigma;), is then added to visibilities. 

-  `plot_fits.py`: it generates plots of a fits image using WCS coordinates. The output image can be saved in pdf or png format. Other plotting
options can be listed with `python plot_fits.py -h` (an updated and improved version can be found __[here](https://github.com/ececcotti/astro-pysEC)__).
